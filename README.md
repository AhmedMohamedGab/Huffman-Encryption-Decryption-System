# Huffman-Encryption-Decryption-System

Huffman Text File Encryption & Decryption

A simple implementation of text file encryption and decryption using Huffman coding.
This project takes a text file as input, compresses it using Huffman’s algorithm, and then allows decryption back to the original file.

📌 Features
- Encode text files using Huffman coding
- Decode encrypted files back to the original
- Works with plain text (.txt) files
- Efficient compression using variable-length codes
- Easy-to-use command-line interface
